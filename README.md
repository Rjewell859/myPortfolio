# myPortfolio

This is my portfolio project. It is a website designed for potential employers to explain a little about me, offer
access to my completed projects and present an option to contact me. 

The basic functions of the website is that it is responsive to resizing the browser or using different devices. 
The overall design is appealing and the content is made to stick out from the background. There are three links
in the navigation bar that will take the user to the corresponding sections. The work section provides projects
with a title, explanation, and image which can be clicked on as a link. The image also appears slightly transparent
when the user puts their mouse pointer over it. The contact form has a brief explanation, and includes fields for
name, message, and an email for me to contact. As well it features a submit button, a checkbox for email consent
and links to social media sites. (for the purpose of this project the contact links are not my actual accounts but serve as placeholders.)
