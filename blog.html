            <h4>Survival Situation</h4>I have always wondered what single item may prove to be most useful to the lone
            survivor washed up on the shore of a tropical deserted island. Is it a mirror to signal for help, a lighter
            for fire starting, or perhaps a tarp for collecting water? The key must be to have something that is
            suitable for several purposes. The only thing that comes to mind when I think about this is the sturdiest
            multipurpose tool of all. A knife. Knives can be used to signal for help, cut through brush, construct
            shelter, hunt, and of course open those demanding yet crucial coconuts for water. That is just the
            beginning, but you can be sure there is no tool that can effictively handle more situations than a trusty
            knife can.

            <h4>Climate Change</h4>It seems people tend to have unrealistic expectations for what is actually happening
            with climate change. With just a few minutes of research online it is clearly not all doom and gloom as
            people might have you think. Of course, we must still continue to care for the planet and minimize waste to
            reverse the cycle. To set the record straight we are not going to see an end to all snow and winter sports
            by the next decade like some people have been saying. Scientists have used simulations in attempts to
            accurately predict the future temperature of the planet. By 2030 it is predicted the temperature may rise
            2.7 degrees Fahrenheit. In the year 2100 predictions are that the temperature may be between 2 and 9.7
            degrees warmer. The change is definitely drastic, but it would not be the end of humanity and it is very
            plausible that 78 years from now we will have discovered a solution.

            <h4>Favorite Recipe</h4>My favorite food will always be banana bread; the great thing is how easy it is to
            make and how it makes use of all of those ugly looking over ripe bananas. Here are the ingredients for the
            recipe I use:
            <ul id="recipe">
                <li>3 overripe bananas</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li> 1 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>2 tsp vanilla extract (normally 1/2 tsp, I use extra)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup chocolate chips</li>
            </ul>Enjoy and don't eat it too fast! Or if you do, just make some more.

            <h4>Aspirations</h4>What have you always thought you should try but never have? I for one can name off a
            few. This question comes to me often as the shame of living so close to the ocean and never once attempting
            to surf is revisited each time I go to the beach. I also have not used a bow an arrow in my lifetime despite
            having an interest in all things medieval and a perfect target that I regularly use only to throw knives at.
            These types of things can really bother us and make us feel lazy. The truth is that there is a simple
            solution, goal setting. Making a bit of effort to try something new each day or allocate some funds for
            lessons can make a huge difference.
